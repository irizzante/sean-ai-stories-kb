**[00:00]** Everyone's the Sean. So, today let's
**[00:01]** talk about loop versus graph
**[00:03]** engineering. Two biggest buzzwords in AI
**[00:06]** agent space recently.
**[00:08]** I am probably exactly like most of you
**[00:10]** guys, which is I don't know how to keep
**[00:12]** up with all these new concepts, but I
**[00:14]** still find it very interesting because
**[00:15]** whenever a new concept becomes viral,
**[00:18]** you don't care about what triggered it.
**[00:20]** What I find out is that this guy called
**[00:22]** Peter Steinberger, who's also the author
**[00:24]** of this little lobster, which is open
**[00:26]** claw, said that are we still talking
**[00:28]** about loops or did we shift to graphs
**[00:31]** yet? And he posted this on July 18th,
**[00:34]** 2026, which is about 13 days ago.
**[00:37]** And he got 3 million views. And look at
**[00:39]** this first comment. It said, "Bro, stop.
**[00:41]** I am on vacation." So, sometimes, you
**[00:44]** know, these important people in the
**[00:46]** space who mention a keyword
**[00:49]** and then everybody's going to start
**[00:50]** talking about it. I remember exactly
**[00:51]** something like that in context
**[00:53]** engineering. And for today's video,
**[00:56]** we're going to demystify all of these
**[00:57]** core AI agent concepts and especially on
**[01:00]** loop and the graph. We're going to jump
**[01:02]** in a little bit on the system design
**[01:04]** real quick. And at the same time, we're
**[01:06]** also going to walk you through real
**[01:07]** coding example
**[01:08]** called Waku-Agent, which is under my
**[01:11]** GitHub, Shen Sean Chen. And we published
**[01:13]** this about 2-3 weeks ago and we got more
**[01:15]** than 700 stars. If you think this video
**[01:17]** is helpful for you, please give us a
**[01:18]** star, give us a like, and that will be
**[01:20]** very helpful for us.
**[01:22]** With Waku Agent, you can launch a
**[01:23]** dashboard like this and you can just ask
**[01:24]** something like,
**[01:26]** "What's up on my Google calendar
**[01:30]** on Thursday?"
**[01:33]** Right? And then it's going to check what
**[01:34]** kind of graph it's going to use, decide
**[01:36]** if it needs to retrieve some memories,
**[01:39]** and then eventually decide, you know,
**[01:40]** what kind of tools it should be using,
**[01:41]** right? Right here it's listing the
**[01:43]** events from my Google calendar and
**[01:45]** eventually send you the reply. And it
**[01:47]** did a bit of a testing in the eval
**[01:49]** system and then, you know, it spit out
**[01:51]** the gave me the final answer for the
**[01:54]** results. I'm I'm to talk a bit more
**[01:56]** details into this, but without further
**[01:57]** ado, let's get started on the system
**[01:59]** design. First thing first, I want to
**[02:01]** talk about the AI agent engineering
**[02:03]** ladder that we have come across over the
**[02:05]** past 3 years, because I think that it
**[02:07]** helps us to kind of understand where we
**[02:11]** came from and where we're going. And the
**[02:13]** first one is obviously prompt
**[02:15]** engineering. And to me, prompt
**[02:16]** engineering was the very first or early
**[02:19]** version of how people start to get used
**[02:21]** to how to use an LLM. I feel the most
**[02:24]** accurate word to describe this was
**[02:26]** role-playing, because at the very
**[02:27]** beginning, we didn't know how to use
**[02:28]** LLMs. We had ChatGPT 3.5, and we tell
**[02:32]** it, "Hey, you are the best poet, like
**[02:34]** you're Shakespeare or Li Bai, right?
**[02:37]** Write me a poem about this scenario I'm
**[02:39]** looking at right now in Switzerland."
**[02:42]** Then, it's going to pretend that it's
**[02:44]** one of those poets you just mentioned
**[02:46]** and then talk to you back, right? That
**[02:47]** was prompt engineering. You basically
**[02:49]** draft the prompt so that you control the
**[02:52]** LLM to talk to you in a certain way you
**[02:54]** want. And then we quickly evolved into
**[02:57]** what we call context engineering, and
**[02:59]** that is because when people move from
**[03:03]** just playing with LLM as a consumer
**[03:05]** product to actual workflows, you realize
**[03:08]** that you not only need prompt, but also
**[03:10]** you need to feed in data. For example,
**[03:13]** if you build a customer service chatbot
**[03:15]** or if you build a sales agent like
**[03:18]** Automaton, which is my company, you need
**[03:19]** to really think about how do you
**[03:21]** construct the context for the agent so
**[03:24]** that the agent will be able to talk to
**[03:26]** the clients on behalf of the businesses,
**[03:29]** right? So, you not only will say, "Hey,
**[03:31]** you are the best salesperson in the
**[03:33]** world." You will talk in certain ways,
**[03:36]** do not say certain things. You also need
**[03:38]** to feed in data such as what are some of
**[03:40]** the what are some of the customer
**[03:41]** relationship data people already have on
**[03:43]** their Excel sheets, Google sheets, CRM
**[03:46]** system, all these kind of things. And
**[03:48]** you need to really put them together and
**[03:50]** and sure that the agent can accurately
**[03:52]** be fed with the right information. So,
**[03:54]** we moved from prompt to context very
**[03:56]** quickly to fix that problem. And then we
**[03:58]** moved on to skills, which I think is
**[04:02]** sort of teaching the AI what kind of
**[04:04]** procedure it should follow. Right? It's
**[04:07]** a procedure following process. In AI
**[04:10]** agent harness, this is called procedural
**[04:12]** memory. It's a memory that you tell say
**[04:14]** you tell a kid, "Hey, when you walk
**[04:17]** home,
**[04:18]** walk on the right-hand side if you're in
**[04:20]** the US or in China. Right? Walk on the
**[04:22]** left-hand side if you're in the UK or
**[04:24]** Japan."
**[04:25]** That is a procedural memory that you
**[04:28]** want a person or you want an LLM to
**[04:31]** remember and there's no, you know, extra
**[04:34]** data. It's just fact that it should be
**[04:35]** doing when a certain situation happens.
**[04:39]** Okay? So, why do we need skills? It's
**[04:41]** because that if you just if you if you
**[04:44]** provide a lot of context to the AI,
**[04:46]** sometimes it can be a little repetitive.
**[04:49]** You don't want to always provide, you
**[04:51]** know, the same order to AI again and
**[04:53]** again and again. So, having a skill to
**[04:56]** determine a workflow becomes really
**[04:58]** really handy. Just like for example, if
**[05:01]** you're coding on Claude code, you don't
**[05:03]** want to explain to Claude that do not
**[05:06]** use emoji. Do not use emoji. Do not use
**[05:08]** emoji. Or I prefer to use emoji. Use
**[05:11]** these emojis. Don't use the brain emoji.
**[05:13]** I hate that. Right? These kind of things
**[05:14]** you have to repeatedly tell the context,
**[05:16]** then it's becoming less convenient. So,
**[05:19]** you can build up skill to make sure the
**[05:21]** LLM is following that procedure. Then
**[05:23]** comes with loop.
**[05:25]** What does loop do? A loop is basically
**[05:28]** saying, "Hey,
**[05:29]** maybe sometimes you have a goal and you
**[05:32]** want to finish that goal,
**[05:34]** but we don't know the exact skills that
**[05:37]** you should have to finish that goal. We
**[05:39]** might tell you, "Hey, there are a bunch
**[05:40]** of tools you can use." Right? That's why
**[05:42]** Anthropic came up with MCPs. You can
**[05:44]** call your Google calendar. You can call
**[05:46]** your Gmails, APIs, you can call your
**[05:48]** GitHub APIs. These tools become handy
**[05:51]** and then you're telling the LM be like,
**[05:54]** "Okay, run a loop. Know your goal, which
**[05:56]** is maybe help me fix this bug that the
**[05:58]** customer come up with.
**[06:00]** Run this loop and here a bunch of tools.
**[06:02]** Here's a web search tool. Here's a bunch
**[06:04]** of API calls. Here's a bunch of MCPs.
**[06:07]** Use them.
**[06:08]** Loop it until at some point you finish
**[06:11]** the goal and that's the end of the
**[06:13]** iteration. And then the question comes,
**[06:15]** why do we need graph?
**[06:18]** What does graph do? Because graph
**[06:19]** technically is a procedure that is
**[06:21]** predetermined.
**[06:23]** Many people are criticizing graph
**[06:24]** engineer is not new because maybe in
**[06:27]** 2023, I remember people were already
**[06:29]** using Airflow, people are using step
**[06:30]** functions, people are talking about how
**[06:33]** do we make sure that a deterministic
**[06:35]** workflow can be set up properly so that
**[06:37]** we don't just tell LM to make all the
**[06:39]** decisions. Because sometimes we know
**[06:40]** exactly how a certain task needs to be
**[06:42]** done. There's a step there. There's an
**[06:43]** SOP there.
**[06:45]** So, to me, it kind of feels like, "Okay,
**[06:48]** we moved from skills, which is strict
**[06:50]** procedure following, to loops, which is,
**[06:53]** 'Hey, agents, go figure it out
**[06:54]** yourself.'
**[06:55]** To eventually we realize that, 'Hey, we
**[06:57]** need a mixture of both.'
**[06:59]** That, in my opinion, is graph. Okay.
**[07:02]** Technically, sometimes you should write
**[07:04]** the skill first.
**[07:06]** Okay? How do you cross the road? On what
**[07:09]** side do you walk in the pavement
**[07:11]** depending on which country you're in?
**[07:13]** And how do you respond to a client? How
**[07:15]** do you respond to me when I'm coding
**[07:16]** with a coding agent, right? And then you
**[07:19]** should turn that into graph. If you see
**[07:21]** that there's a lot of repetition in the
**[07:22]** workflows, especially if you're building
**[07:23]** a workflow for corporate, right? If
**[07:25]** you're working in uh e-commerce, maybe
**[07:28]** you see exactly how your customer
**[07:30]** service should be answering questions
**[07:32]** related to logistics, to refund, to
**[07:34]** checking samples. You realize that you
**[07:37]** can really consolidate this into a graph
**[07:39]** when the workflow stops changing.
**[07:41]** Perhaps there's still part of the
**[07:42]** workflow that you need to use a loop,
**[07:44]** where the loop is basically doing this
**[07:47]** exploratory work out there, right? It's
**[07:49]** probably doing, you know, a bunch of
**[07:50]** research for you. Um, I think deep
**[07:52]** research is one of the early examples of
**[07:55]** a loop engineering workflow here, where
**[07:57]** you just say, "Hey, go crazy. Just go
**[07:59]** search the internet. I want a report."
**[08:01]** These kind of work are, you know, less
**[08:03]** standardized or it doesn't have an SOP
**[08:05]** in it. It's just about, "I want more
**[08:08]** information or I have a certain goal.
**[08:11]** Use the tools available to you to figure
**[08:13]** it out for me." It's quite different
**[08:15]** from graph, because sometimes we know
**[08:17]** exactly what tools they should be using
**[08:19]** to uh finalize a task for me. Okay,
**[08:22]** guys, that was a conceptual walk-through
**[08:25]** of this AI agent engineering ladder.
**[08:28]** Now, let's take a look at what a loop
**[08:30]** and a graph look like. What a loop does
**[08:33]** is that it discovers what to do next.
**[08:35]** So, maybe this is you, and you ask a
**[08:37]** question to the LLM, and the LLM is
**[08:39]** basically saying, "Hey, do I need to use
**[08:41]** any tools? If yes, choose a tool, run
**[08:44]** it, and check if it finished the task,
**[08:47]** come back to the LLM, and then loop it
**[08:49]** again and again and again until at some
**[08:51]** point LLM is like, "Hey,
**[08:53]** we don't need a tool anymore. Let's
**[08:55]** reply to the user." Examples here could
**[08:57]** be like, you are trying to fix a bug on
**[09:00]** a pull request on GitHub. You basically
**[09:02]** ask Claude Code or a Codex and be like,
**[09:05]** "Fix this bug. Tell me when it's fixed."
**[09:07]** And it's going to go ahead and then use
**[09:09]** a bunch of tools like web search, GitHub
**[09:11]** CLI, checking your Supabase, checking
**[09:13]** your AWS, checking your Google Cloud,
**[09:15]** all these kind of stuff. And then at the
**[09:17]** end saying, "Okay, we're done. Okay, and
**[09:20]** the bug is fixed because ABCD." That is
**[09:22]** a loop.
**[09:23]** A graph, on the other hand,
**[09:26]** is somewhat similar, but uh it's not
**[09:28]** exactly the same. So, you might have a
**[09:30]** So, you might have a standardized
**[09:31]** process every day and be like, "Ooh, I
**[09:33]** want to understand how many people have
**[09:35]** submitted pull requests overnight, and
**[09:37]** who are these guys who submitted some
**[09:39]** tasks? Can we take a look at them? And
**[09:42]** uh tell me if uh things are fixed or
**[09:45]** not. And maybe at the same time, I want
**[09:47]** to understand you know, what are some of
**[09:49]** the latest news out there on AI agents?
**[09:51]** And maybe we want to do some web search
**[09:53]** as well. Maybe we want to run some, you
**[09:55]** know, get commands. At the same time, we
**[09:57]** know exactly how it works. Okay.
**[09:59]** And then, you probably want this to be
**[10:02]** done in parallel. So, you ask a
**[10:04]** question, and then it's going to check
**[10:05]** out the GitHub to check out the pull
**[10:07]** request. It's going to search the
**[10:08]** website for you to do some exploratory
**[10:11]** analysis.
**[10:12]** And it's probably also going to check
**[10:13]** your calendar, plus the memories stored
**[10:16]** locally or on the cloud.
**[10:19]** And then it's going to synthesize these
**[10:20]** information and tell us, "Hey, is there
**[10:22]** anything else to do? If not, end this
**[10:25]** and reply. If yes, please explain what
**[10:28]** kind of things do you still need to do?"
**[10:30]** Okay. You see the difference here? So,
**[10:32]** sometimes you can have some loops here.
**[10:34]** Okay? Maybe having agent
**[10:36]** Maybe having an agent loop to search the
**[10:38]** web or have an agent loop to fix the
**[10:40]** bugs on GitHub is part of this graph.
**[10:42]** Okay? So, you can see graph is basically
**[10:44]** saying, "Okay, I know exactly what you
**[10:46]** should be checking. Maybe they're in
**[10:48]** parallel. Maybe they are happening in
**[10:50]** sequences.
**[10:51]** Do it the way I want. And uh once you
**[10:54]** finish, uh synthesize it and tell me the
**[10:56]** answer." Are you guys still with me?
**[10:58]** Let's check a real example first.
**[11:00]** Come back here. Let's come to Waku agent
**[11:02]** dashboard. The way you set it up, by the
**[11:04]** way, is come to this website,
**[11:06]** github.com/jasonchan/waku-agent.
**[11:09]** You can either click on code and copy
**[11:11]** this and then type into your terminal
**[11:14]** and say get clone and paste that in and
**[11:17]** hit enter, which is this way, and you
**[11:19]** can just copy this and paste in your
**[11:20]** terminal. Or recently, we released a new
**[11:23]** package in Python called waku-agent. All
**[11:26]** you need to do is copy this, pip install
**[11:28]** the Waku agent into your terminal, set
**[11:30]** up your environmental keys, and then you
**[11:32]** can launch a dashboard. Copy this.
**[11:36]** Paste this in.
**[11:39]** Because I'm already using port 777, so
**[11:42]** let's use 778 as an example.
**[11:45]** Paste that in. You can see, this is it.
**[11:47]** Okay.
**[11:48]** Since I already set it up, I'll come
**[11:49]** back to this local host 7777.
**[11:52]** So, what you're seeing right here is is
**[11:54]** an entire AI agent harness starting from
**[11:56]** the gateway, which can be the chat of
**[11:58]** here, or you can use some other channels
**[12:01]** such as Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp,
**[12:03]** stuff like that.
**[12:04]** And then it's going to check out the
**[12:06]** retrieval gate to see if you we need any
**[12:08]** procedural memory, which is skills, as
**[12:10]** we mentioned, or semantic memory or
**[12:12]** episodic memory, which are durable facts
**[12:15]** or the dated events that happened in
**[12:17]** your local memories. Okay. And then it's
**[12:19]** going to run through an agent loop using
**[12:20]** LLM agents and calling tools, and
**[12:23]** eventually give you the reply, during
**[12:24]** which the LLM ops is going to trace the
**[12:26]** data, test it, and then release it, the
**[12:29]** new version of the prompt, and the
**[12:31]** feedback to the harness. But this is the
**[12:33]** entire harness, okay? And loop
**[12:35]** engineering is happening here in this
**[12:36]** little loop.
**[12:38]** A graph workflow is basically after this
**[12:40]** gateway, you can predefine some of the
**[12:43]** process in between here. So, we have a
**[12:44]** new tab called graph. We currently have
**[12:46]** two graphs here. One is called triage,
**[12:48]** another one is called gather. For triage
**[12:51]** graph, what it does is that it's saying,
**[12:53]** okay, start point, and then it's going
**[12:55]** to classify if it requires some agent
**[12:58]** calls, and then at the same time, it
**[12:59]** might just check out my calendar and see
**[13:01]** what's going on. Okay. And I can just be
**[13:03]** like, what's up today?
**[13:07]** All right. You can see the trigger this
**[13:09]** triage first.
**[13:10]** Right. It checked the Google calendar
**[13:11]** for me, and also at the same time it was
**[13:13]** checking, you know, if we need to have
**[13:15]** some uh
**[13:16]** need to do some serious agent calls
**[13:18]** here. And it eventually decided that,
**[13:21]** okay, it's going to use some tools, so
**[13:22]** they used the list events, read the
**[13:24]** Apple calendar for me. So, you just saw
**[13:26]** a very simple graph kind of call
**[13:28]** already, okay? So, what it did was that
**[13:31]** it checked, as I mentioned, if it needs
**[13:34]** some serious agent calls, and in
**[13:36]** parallel at the same time was already
**[13:38]** checking my calendar because I was
**[13:39]** asking what's up today. And then after
**[13:41]** that, use this loop to run to call the
**[13:43]** tools like list events, read Apple
**[13:45]** calendar, and all these kind of stuff,
**[13:47]** and then give me the reply, okay? But
**[13:49]** what if I need to test something else?
**[13:51]** So, here in this local agent harness,
**[13:53]** what I recently updated is that you can
**[13:56]** very clearly mention the workflow you
**[13:58]** built in the graph we have gathered. So,
**[14:00]** we can clearly say {slash} gather, and
**[14:03]** then say, "Tell me what's up with Waku
**[14:06]** agents and any new PRs, any competitive
**[14:09]** projects?" Let's see what happens.
**[14:12]** You see that it triggered this graph
**[14:13]** instead, okay? Let's come back to the
**[14:15]** overview. It's showing me that it was
**[14:17]** triggering triggering this graph,
**[14:19]** and it used these tools simultaneously,
**[14:23]** and then it's synthesizing the answers
**[14:25]** for me, okay? So, So, what it did was
**[14:28]** that it gave me a morning brief on what
**[14:31]** kind of PRs are out there, and we have
**[14:34]** released a new package, which you can
**[14:36]** check in this GitHub. If you scroll down
**[14:38]** a little bit, we have released a new
**[14:39]** package for agent graphs recently.
**[14:42]** And also there are some PRs to be
**[14:44]** reviewed, okay? Let's come here.
**[14:47]** So, if you click into pull request, you
**[14:49]** can see there are some PRs here for me
**[14:50]** to be reviewed. And for the web search,
**[14:52]** you can see that it researched about
**[14:55]** Harrison Chase published your harness,
**[14:56]** your memory, and your own videos in
**[14:59]** Harness Eval our ranking.
**[15:01]** Okay? It was doing the committed
**[15:03]** research for me as well.
**[15:05]** All right. So, you might be wondering,
**[15:07]** how did this work? If we come back to
**[15:08]** the tab for graph, you can see that we
**[15:11]** clearly defined two different use cases
**[15:13]** of graph. One is triage, another one is
**[15:14]** gather, and they have very specific ways
**[15:18]** of running the agents. And they both use
**[15:21]** loops because when it does the web
**[15:22]** search, it needs to search for the
**[15:24]** information and come back to me, right?
**[15:26]** When it does the check calendar, it's
**[15:27]** going to check the calendar until it
**[15:29]** find out what's going on in my calendar
**[15:31]** and then come back to me. Okay? These
**[15:33]** things are all kind of intertwined in
**[15:34]** this agent harness system. So, if we
**[15:36]** come back to the system design, there's
**[15:38]** something interesting I wanted to show
**[15:39]** you, which is how exactly did the
**[15:42]** workflow finish from the beginning to
**[15:43]** the end from a time usage and parallel
**[15:46]** processing perspective. For the loop, an
**[15:49]** agent loop, for example, web search is
**[15:51]** going to decide what's going to do
**[15:52]** first, right? It's going to check out my
**[15:54]** GitHub calling tools one by one, right?
**[15:57]** Maybe after the first call, the agent
**[15:59]** decided, "Okay, we need to do one more
**[16:01]** call." And then it called again. And
**[16:03]** then it checked the calendar. And then
**[16:05]** it synthesized information for me.
**[16:07]** But in the graph example, which is
**[16:10]** this which is this workflow for
**[16:12]** gathering information, it used multiple
**[16:15]** tools in parallel because we already
**[16:16]** told it, "You need these four tools."
**[16:18]** All right? Maybe each one of them spent
**[16:19]** different amount of time. And then it
**[16:21]** did the GitHub first and the web search
**[16:23]** did the most amount of time. Calendar
**[16:25]** check and memory retrieval did the least
**[16:27]** amount of time because it's instant or
**[16:29]** maybe because you did not need any
**[16:31]** memory retrieval at all. And then it's
**[16:33]** going to synthesize the information
**[16:35]** because it's got a lot of context at the
**[16:36]** same time. So, you cannot say So, you
**[16:39]** cannot say graph engineering is
**[16:41]** replacing loop engineering because
**[16:42]** they're coexisting. And you cannot say
**[16:44]** loop engineering or graph engineering is
**[16:46]** better than the other one because we
**[16:47]** need them in different use cases. A loop
**[16:50]** is something you need when the model
**[16:51]** decides what to call one step at a time.
**[16:54]** A graph is something like when you know
**[16:55]** the shape and you just want them to move
**[16:59]** together. Okay? It really depends on the
**[17:01]** situations you're building for. In your
**[17:03]** local files, we have a Waku folder and
**[17:06]** then we have a graph folder.
**[17:08]** And within the graph folder, we have
**[17:10]** defined the graph engines, which is
**[17:14]** literally a graph.
**[17:16]** And you're going to add nodes, which in
**[17:18]** our case could be web search tools,
**[17:20]** could be agent calls, could be MCPs,
**[17:22]** anything. Right? And then you're also
**[17:24]** defining edges, which is okay, do we
**[17:26]** where do we go after using one tool?
**[17:29]** Right? After the web search, do we go
**[17:30]** synthesizing or do we go somewhere else?
**[17:32]** Right?
**[17:34]** graph We also defined nodes, which is
**[17:37]** basically saying what kind of things can
**[17:39]** be a node, right? Tool calls, LLM calls,
**[17:42]** agent calls,
**[17:44]** router, these kind of things.
**[17:46]** And then under this graph folder, we
**[17:47]** also have another folder called
**[17:48]** workflows.
**[17:49]** You can see we have triage here. Right?
**[17:52]** Remember triage was the chart we showed
**[17:53]** you, which is it's going to classify if
**[17:55]** it needs to use some complex models to
**[17:57]** do agent calls
**[17:58]** or is it doing some calendar checking at
**[18:01]** the same time? These two things are
**[18:02]** happening in parallel at the same time.
**[18:05]** And the code is actually very simple.
**[18:06]** You define
**[18:07]** these functionalities to make sure that
**[18:09]** the triage graph is working properly
**[18:12]** with this predefined workflows. Right?
**[18:15]** You add node when you need to add in one
**[18:16]** more tools. You add edges by defining
**[18:19]** initial prompt from start can go to
**[18:22]** either classify or check calendar at the
**[18:24]** same time.
**[18:26]** If we check out the gather tool as well,
**[18:29]** remember it's the similar thing as our
**[18:31]** previous chart. You can scan the GitHub,
**[18:33]** website, check calendar, memory. Okay?
**[18:36]** GitHub, website, calendar, memory.
**[18:39]** These are all the nodes and after that
**[18:41]** you synthesize it and then you decide if
**[18:43]** we should return the answer. Obviously,
**[18:45]** we're doing the same thing. We're
**[18:46]** building the graph here, right? We're
**[18:48]** adding these nodes
**[18:50]** and we are adding those edges too. I
**[18:53]** hope this is easy to understand. And you
**[18:55]** can feel free to add more .py files here
**[18:58]** to make this graph workflows even
**[19:01]** larger. And in that case, I will have to
**[19:03]** work with you and then you can feel free
**[19:04]** to contribute to this repo and be one of
**[19:07]** our contributors and submit your own
**[19:08]** workflows because once you submit your
**[19:11]** own workflows and it's approved, it will
**[19:13]** be available here. If I type in {slash}
**[19:16]** graphs, it's going to tell me that
**[19:20]** it has gather, it has triage, and triage
**[19:22]** is the router. It's basically going to
**[19:24]** read the local files of these workflows
**[19:26]** from graphs, and people can use it. This
**[19:29]** would be very cool, and it will probably
**[19:31]** become a community if you guys are
**[19:32]** interested. And feel free to be our
**[19:34]** contributors. And also, if you're
**[19:36]** interested in talking more in depth of
**[19:38]** these concepts with us, if you feel you
**[19:39]** want to discuss with me about your
**[19:41]** workflows and any questions you have
**[19:42]** about system design, about these agent
**[19:44]** harness, all these kind of stuff, you
**[19:45]** can feel free to come to my personal
**[19:47]** website, shaunchand.io, and then click
**[19:49]** on join over here to join our community.
**[19:52]** I'm just getting started to do this
**[19:54]** because I don't have enough time to
**[19:55]** answer all of your questions. I feel
**[19:57]** like the most efficient way is that I
**[19:58]** can host some live sessions with you uh
**[20:00]** twice a month, so that I'll be able to
**[20:02]** answer most of your questions, and we
**[20:04]** can prepare some, you know, build
**[20:05]** sessions real time, showing you my real
**[20:07]** setup, all these kind of stuff. If you
**[20:08]** join this community, you will be
**[20:10]** assigned to a private Discord,
**[20:13]** and I will share more details there,
**[20:15]** including the original files of all of
**[20:17]** these system design charts that I have
**[20:19]** built in the past uh in real code, so
**[20:21]** that you can sort of open it in your own
**[20:23]** Excalidraw website to learn about it.
**[20:26]** So, last but not least, I think this is
**[20:27]** an important question we should ask
**[20:29]** ourselves, which is
**[20:31]** isn't this just a deterministic workflow
**[20:32]** from 2023? What is new now is that some
**[20:35]** of the nodes we're using right now are
**[20:37]** non-deterministic. Could be a LLM call.
**[20:39]** And at the same time, sometimes the
**[20:41]** model can pick the edge, all right? The
**[20:43]** routing is the way that, you know,
**[20:45]** you're letting the LLM as a judge, do I
**[20:47]** pick a simple model to answer the
**[20:49]** questions, or do I use a more complex
**[20:53]** model to answer this question? And also,
**[20:55]** you need some guards, which a previous
**[20:58]** directional graph scheduling never did.
**[21:00]** These are buzzwords, as I mentioned, but
**[21:02]** buzzwords are viral for a reason.
**[21:04]** Sometimes it's because of famous people,
**[21:05]** sometimes because it's actually useful.
**[21:07]** So, I hope this kind of videos is
**[21:10]** helpful for you. And again, if you have
**[21:12]** any questions, feel free to ask me. And
**[21:14]** I would love to answer your questions
**[21:16]** live in our community. Just come to my
**[21:18]** personal website shaun.io and then there
**[21:20]** are a bunch of sources here. Looking
**[21:22]** forward to And if you love this project,
**[21:24]** please give a star on GitHub repo and I
**[21:26]** would love to work with you. Thank you
**[21:28]** so much for your attention. Appreciate
**[21:30]** it.
